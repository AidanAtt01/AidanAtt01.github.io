        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Aidan Attmore, I am a sophomore computer information systems major. My 
mission is to learn how to effectively understand and solve a wide variety of computer 
related issues, while having the diversity of business skills to be able to connect with and 
solve any issues that may arise. There is often a gap between technical and general 
business teams that I am learning to bridge in order to save both time and money for the 
company that I work for.</p>
